     * Given the root node of a binary search tree, return the sum of values of all nodes with value between L and R (inclusive).
     * <p>
     * The binary search tree is guaranteed to have unique values.
     * <p>
     * <p>
     * <p>
     * Example 1:
     * <p>
     * Input: root = [10,5,15,3,7,null,18], L = 7, R = 15
     * Output: 32
     * Example 2:
     * <p>
     * Input: root = [10,5,15,3,7,13,18,1,null,6], L = 6, R = 10
     * Output: 23

     * <p>
     * Note:
     * <p>
     * The number of nodes in the tree is at most 10000.
     * The final answer is guaranteed to be less than 2^31.
