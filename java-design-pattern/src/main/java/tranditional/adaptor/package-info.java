/*
  existed business code class realization 1  source, And client has a api using interface target as param. It will cost a lot if you
  change the api, However, you want to make the param realize the source business in the te prams, Now it's a chance to use the adapter
  design pattern , you do not have to change te interface or inject a source class(of course, you can do it), But, it costs a lot if you
  the api is the third party api.
